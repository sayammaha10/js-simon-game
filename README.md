# Simon Game Web App

This is a fun and interactive **Simon Game** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (with jQuery). The game challenges users to test their memory by repeating a sequence of colors and sounds that gets longer with each level.

## Features

- **Start the Game**: Begin the game by pressing any key.
- **Random Sequence Generation**: Each round adds a new randomly selected color to the pattern.
- **User Interaction**: Click buttons to repeat the sequence.
- **Audio and Visual Feedback**: Buttons flash and play sounds to enhance user experience.
- **Level Progression**: Increases difficulty with every correct round.
- **Game Over Logic**: Incorrect selections end the game with a ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù message and sound.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, user interaction, and level tracking.
- **jQuery**: For simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.
